# Challenging a player

In order to begin a new game, you must first challenge a player.

> __Note: Please ensure that the ChessBot is invited to the channel or private message__
> __with the other party that you are challenging in order for the bot to "hear" the challenge.__

To do so, mention the ChessBot and the user you wish to challenge.

```
@chessbot challenge @chris
```
